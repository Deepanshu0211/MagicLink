**Window Linked Particle Sphere** — by [deepanshu0211](https://github.com/deepanshu0211)

A stunning particle simulation where multiple browser windows share a cosmic connection.  
Particles orbit inside 3D spheres, with dynamic auras linking windows based on distance.  
When the link snaps, an explosion and shockwave ripple through the universe.

---

### ✨ Features
- 3D particle motion with bouncing and gyro-like behavior
- Aura beam that pulses, wiggles, and snaps if windows drift too far
- Particle explosions and fading comet trails
- Shockwave ripples when auras break
- Smooth gravity pullback after explosions
- Clean, minimal HTML/CSS/JS structure

---

### 🚀 How it Works
- Open the page locally (`localhost` or just double-click the HTML)
- Open multiple windows of the same page
- Move the windows around:
  - **Windows "feel" each other** and link with an energy beam  
  - **Connection changes color and strength** based on distance  
  - **If pulled apart too far, the aura snaps with particle explosions and shockwaves

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML5 Canvas
- Vanilla JavaScript (no libraries)
- LocalStorage & simple window messaging for cross-window sync

---

### 📦 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepanshu0211/MagicLink.git
2. Open index.html directly, or serve it with a local server:
    ```bash
    npx serve
### 🧠 Future Ideas
  - Color theme selector (e.g., Nebula, Firestorm, Deep Sea)
  - Sound effects (shockwave booms, ambient aura hums)
  - More complex particle behaviors (black hole collapse, repulsion forces)
